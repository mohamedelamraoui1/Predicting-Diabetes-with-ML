# Diabetes Prediction with Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to predict diabetes using medical and demographic data with machine learning algorithms (KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest). The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle - Diabetes Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset).

## Objectives
- Compare the performance of KNN, SVM, DT, and RF for binary classification (diabetes: 0 or 1).
- Analyze the dataset, preprocess it (encoding, outlier removal, scaling), and evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall.
- Discuss limitations and propose improvements.

## Key Findings
- Random Forest (RF) outperforms others in cross-validation (accuracy: 0.972, F1-score: 0.813).
- Decision Tree (DT) and RF show overfitting in validation (accuracy: 1.00).
- Class imbalance (91.5% non-diabetic vs 8.5% diabetic) impacts recall for KNN and SVM.
